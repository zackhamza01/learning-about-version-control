# learning-about-version-control
Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I love most about version control is that you can collaborate on the same repository/documents with multiple people, so it is like doing teamwork to get a common task done.
What I find frustrating about version control is situations where a team works simultaneously on the same files, at which point you need to worry about resolving merge conflicts. Resolving merge conflicts is a bit annoying to me.
